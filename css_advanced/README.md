# CSS Advanced - ALX Project

This project builds upon the HTML Advanced project by applying complete styling using CSS. The design reference is provided via Figma and represents a professional and responsive website layout.

## 📄 Project Objectives

- Recreate the design shared in the Figma file using only HTML and CSS.
- Maintain responsive and accessible web design principles.
- Apply custom fonts, icons, layout styles, and advanced CSS techniques.
- Ensure all elements match the Figma specification visually.

## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure of the website.
- `styles/` - Folder for all CSS files (to be created in later tasks).
- `images/` - Folder with all images used in the project.
